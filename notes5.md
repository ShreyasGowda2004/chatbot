# Document 5: Dogs & Docs

Markdown about dogs, stories, and documentation tips.

## Dog Facts
- Dogs can learn over 100 words and gestures.
- The Basenji dog doesn't bark, it yodels.
- Dogs' noses are as unique as fingerprints.

## Short Story
Max, a golden retriever, loved fetching sticks. One day, he found a stick shaped like a heart and brought it to his owner, who smiled and hugged him tight.

## Code Example
```javascript
// Check if a dog knows a trick
function knowsTrick(dog, trick) {
  return dog.tricks.includes(trick);
}
```

## Documentation Tips
- Use markdown for clear docs
- Write examples for every function
- Keep docs up to date
