# Document 9: Birds & Automation

Markdown about birds, long flights, and automation.

## Bird Facts
- The Arctic Tern migrates farther than any other bird (up to 44,000 miles a year).
- Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backwards.
- Ostriches are the largest birds in the world.

## Short Story
A young bird named Sky wanted to see the world. It learned to fly, soared above mountains, and realized the sky had no limits.

## Code Example
```python
# Check if a bird can fly
def can_fly(bird):
    return bird.lower() not in ['ostrich', 'penguin', 'emu']
```
