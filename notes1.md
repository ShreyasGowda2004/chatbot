# Document 1: Weather & Notes

This markdown file contains random facts, a short story, and a code snippet.

## Quick Facts
- The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering.
- Rainbows appear when sunlight is refracted through water droplets.
- The hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth was 56.7°C (134°F) in Death Valley, USA.

## Short Story
Once upon a time, a cloud wanted to see the world. It floated over mountains, rivers, and cities, raining where needed and shading children at play. The cloud realized that every place had its own beauty, just like every day has its own weather.

## Code Example
```python
# Simple weather check
def is_rainy(weather):
    return 'rain' in weather.lower()
```

## Notes Section
- Markdown is great for notes and documentation.
