# Document 7: Water & Tests

A markdown file about water, science, and testing.

## Water Facts
- Water covers about 71% of Earth's surface.
- Ice is less dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats.
- Pure water has a neutral pH of 7.

## Short Story
A drop of water fell from a leaf into a pond, joining millions of others. It traveled through rivers, oceans, clouds, and rain, always part of Earth's water cycle.

## Code Example
```python
# Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
def c_to_f(c):
    return (c * 9/5) + 32
```

## Test Checklist
- [x] Boil water
- [x] Measure temperature
- [ ] Freeze water
