# Document 4: Earth & Markdown

A markdown file about our planet and markdown tricks.

## Earth Facts
- The Earth is about 4.54 billion years old.
- 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water.
- The Earth's core is as hot as the Sun's surface.

## Short Story
A pebble sat on a riverbank, watching the world change for centuries. It saw dinosaurs, then people, then bridges. The pebble realized it was part of Earth's long story.

## Code Example
```java
// Calculate Earth's gravity
public double gravity(double mass, double radius) {
    double G = 6.674e-11;
    return (G * mass) / (radius * radius);
}
```

## Markdown Tips
- Use `#` for headings
- Use `*` or `-` for lists
- Code blocks use triple backticks
